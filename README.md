# pacman_search_agent

The Pacman AI projects were developed at UC Berkeley. https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su20/project1/

I'm using this pacman framework to develop and test the following algorithms:
*  Depth First Search
*  Breadth First Search
*  Uniform Cost Search


I also developed a Hanoi Tower's game to verify how general are all the search algorithms developed.
